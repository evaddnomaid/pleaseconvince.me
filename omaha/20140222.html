<p>What would YOU like to discuss? Here are the suggested topics we've received so far:</p>



<h2>Justified Violence</h2>

<p>Jay writes: Have you seen these movies? In my opinion there is a massive difference between
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535109/">Captain Phillips</a> and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790885/">Zero Dark Thirty</a>
in terms of justified violence. Both feature efficient military killing of criminals,
but I find a polar split in the ethics of the two situations. Do you?
</p>



<h2>Freedom of Religion(?)</h2>

<p>Jay writes: Did you see this tweet? 
What powers, if any, should universities have to curtail freedom of assembly?
Does a religious context matter?
Is this a feminist issue? How so?
</p>

<h2>Militarization of Police</h2>

<p>Jay writes: Did you read this Des Moines news story? 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2014/02/04/scenes-from-a-militarized-america-iowa-family-terrorized/">Scenes from a militarized America: Iowa family ‘terrorized’</a>.
How much probable cause do you need to SWAT a citizen's house? Was that standard met in this case?
</p>



<h2>Racial Segregation in Omaha</h2>

<p>Jay writes: I expected to see racial clustering in Omaha, but I was amazed by
this map. The edges aren't nearly as stark as Detroit, but I still found this shocking.
Is this map what YOU expected to see? Is this healthy? 
What amount of voluntary(?) segregation is OK? What amount is troubling?
Should things be done?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wow. Racial segregation in Omaha. <a href="http://t.co/apUNqC0i5e">http://t.co/apUNqC0i5e</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23racialdotmap&amp;src=hash">#racialdotmap</a> <a href="http://t.co/jBRWGNAAey">pic.twitter.com/jBRWGNAAey</a></p>&mdash; Jay Hannah (@deafferret) <a href="https://twitter.com/deafferret/statuses/423782306466123776">January 16, 2014</a></blockquote>

<h2>Answering Your Door with a Gun</h2>

<p>Jay writes: This happened 2 blocks from my parent's house: <a href="http://www.examiner.net/article/20140122/News/140129652">Angry neighbor charged in couple's shootings</a>. Sigh. Anyone want to talk about "gun culture" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine">Castle doctrine</a>?
