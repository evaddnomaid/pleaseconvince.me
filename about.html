<h1>About PleaseConvince.Me</h1>


<h2>The Problem(s)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Politics is ugly.
<li>Participants typically band together with people who already agree with them.
<li>When not in their own echo chamber, participants shout slogans past each other. 
    No one is listening.
<li>It's rare that anyone changes their mind. About anything. 
<li>When you seek information on an issue/candidate, you'll probably receive canned sound 
    bites from sources with vested interest in their agenda.
<li>Most available information is heavily polarized / partisan.
<li>I don't know what will be on my upcoming ballot.
<li>I don't have any idea how I should vote for issue/candidate X.
<li>"Why would <b>anyone</b> vote for/against issue/candidate X? Everyone I know is voting
    the way I am, and everyone on the other side of this issue/candidate just wants to yell
    at me."
</ul>


<h2>The Proposal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a resource where people who are <b>seeking</b> to educate themselves can contact
    other people who:
    <ul>
    <li>know and care about issue/candidate X when I don't (yet) have an opinion.
    <li>are (probably) voting <b>differently</b> than I am once I do have an opinion.
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
We can all become more educated and thoughtful in our politics by <b>intentionally</b> and 
<b>respectfully</b> seeking the thoughts of people who are educated, opinionated, and 
<b>disagree</b> with our own views.
</p>


<h2>PleaseConvince.Me IS NOT</h2>
<ul>
<li>A place to post your boilerplate.
<li>A place to be disrespectful to others.
<li>A spammer resource.
<li>A place to gang up together in a private echo chamber.
</ul>


<h2>Personal Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jay Hannah: No clue what's on upcoming ballot. Never heard of most of these local people. 
    Voting party lines makes me sad, is not helping us build a better society.
    Would like to find friendly, respectful people on the other side of an issue in order 
    to understand where they're coming from. (My parents do too, on the issues they are passionate
    about.)
</ul>
